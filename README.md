This project aims to analyze EEG signals to identify the presence of Alzheimer's disease. EEG
data come from healthy and affected patients, with recordings for both "eyes open" and "eyes
closed" states. The goal is to build machine learning models to distinguish patients with the
disease from healthy ones. Several algorithms are applied to evaluate the accuracy and
robustness of each approach.
